- The basic idea of the project is to categorize the credit card expenses based on location, time, date, type of category the expense falls into and display (visualize the data) in the form of charts/graphs. 
- We are expected to include 4/5 categories.
- Examples of categories are : Pharmacy,Doctors,Daycare,Schools,Restaurants,Entertainment(movies,game zones),Shopping etc.
- We should also include the different states the user travels and the type of expenses in each state.

### We should be able to build the following prototype(Web application) of the system:
    - Design a database
    - Build GUI
    - Dashboard which generates 2/3 graphs 
    - User should be able to view the transaction and update the category if he would like to.
    - Once the transaction is entered into the table, it should be picked up right away into a category by running a script.
    - Simulate and generate the report.


### Component (Truc Suggestion):
    - Back End (Database/Sever): C#, Java
    - Front End (Gui, Database/Client/Machine Learning): R, Python, JavaScript, HTML
